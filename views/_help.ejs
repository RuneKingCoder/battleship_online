<h1>Battleship Online</h1>
<p>
  Play the classic guessing game
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)" target="_blank">
    <em>Battleship</em>
  </a>
  against other players or the computer.
</p>

<h3>Choosing a name</h3>
<p>
  To be able to play, you have to enter your nickname. This name has to be unique, which means
  that it is currently not used by another logged in player.
</p>

<h3>Setting up a game</h3>
<p>
  After you have entered your name, you have the option to <em>Host</em> or <em>Join</em> a
  game, or to play against the computer. If you choose <em>Host</em>, your name will appear in the
  host list and other players can join your game. If you choose <em>Join</em>, the host list will
  open, enabling you to join games that other players have hosted. To play against the computer,
  select <em>vs AI</em>. Here, you have the option to play on easy or normal difficulty.
</p>

<h3>Battle preparations</h3>
<p>
  Once you are connected with another player or an AI opponent, you will be asked to finish
  your ship placement and to press <em>Ready</em>.
</p>
<h5>Placing your ships</h5>
<p>
  To rotate a ship, click/tap on it, to move it around use drag and drop. Ships are not allowed
  to overlap, or to be placed directly next to each other. Invalid ship placements are signaled
  using color codes. As long as your grid contains tiles in these colors, the game is
  not allowed to start:
</p>
<table id="placement-colors"><tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><span id="color-overlap"></span></td>
    <td>ships are overlapping</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span id="color-adjacent"></span></td>
    <td>ships are placed directly next to each other</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
  If you don't want to manually place your ships, you can generate a new random ship placement
  by pressing <em>Randomize</em>. This placement will always be valid.
</p>

<h3>Combat</h3>
<p>
  Once both players have pressed <em>Ready</em>, the battle commences. The player who pressed
  <em>Ready</em> first will be the first one to shoot. If you play against the computer, you will
  always take the first shot. You can shoot by simply clicking/tapping
  a tile in the grid. If you miss a shot, the opponent gets to shoot next. If you hit a ship,
  you are allowed to fire another shot until you miss. If you sink a ship of the opponent, that
  ship will be revealed to you. The player who manages to sink all of the opponent's ships first
  wins the game.
</p>

<h3>Rematch</h3>
<p>
  After each battle, both players will be asked if they want to play another match against each
  other. If both choose <em>Yes</em>, they will be able to change their ship placements and start
  another battle. The computer will always want another regame and will always change its ship
  placements before the next battle.
